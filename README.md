#Ion Auth 2
###The future of authentication
by [Ben Edmunds](http://benedmunds.com)

Redux Auth 2 had a lot of potential.  It's lightweight, simple, and clean, 
but had a ton of bugs and was missing some key features.  So we refactored 
the code and added new features.

This version drops any backwards compatibility and makes things even more 
awesome then you could expect.
